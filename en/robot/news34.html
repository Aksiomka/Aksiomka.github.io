<p>The <a href="https://blazar.art/" target="_blank">blazar</a> Fair ended on Sunday. It was the first fair I participated in. At the same time, it was very large-scale,
bright and unforgettable. This year more than 30,000 people visited blazar. Of course, there were a lot of interesting and memorable works at the fair.</p>

<p>The exhibition was constantly updated, as the sold works were immediately replaced with others.
I spent quite a lot of time at my booth, talking to people, answering questions. My work was reviewed, photographed, and discussed. Two of my works were sold.</p>
